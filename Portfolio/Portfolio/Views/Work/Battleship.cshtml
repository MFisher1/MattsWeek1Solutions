<h3>What it took</h3>
<p>Though Battleship in principal is a very simple game, to make it work in code is a whole different story. Making a computer be able to make even simple descsions
    by itself, and allowing the user to interact with it in a simple manner that allows for error takes a lot of planning and hardwork.Some programing techniques 
    I used were, classes, lambda expressions, enumerations, and functions. It took about 5 hours to write and another 3 of debugging. This program really represents
    everything I've learned about C# and visual studio.
